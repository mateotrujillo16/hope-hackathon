      <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
      <p class="statement">Over the past few years, we at Sunny Skies have been dedicated to informing people about the
        environment, and what we can possibly do to change it.
        In this case, that could be as easy as noticing a slightly smokier sky, and taking the steps to apprehend
        whatever is causing the problem.
        Listen, we know that protecting the environment isn't as easy as us snapping our fingers, but it could be as
        easy as you being aware of the quality of your air, of if there's pollen in the sky.
        We at Sunny Skies take pride in providing the services we can to help others educate themselves on our
        environment.</p>

      <h3>So what can <b>you</b> do?</h3>
      <p class="statement"> Pollution isn't <b>just</b> a thick fog in the air. Every second you choose to drive, you
        are in a way, assisting in spreading pollution.
        With the growth of technology, society is being handed plenty of ways to aid in the environment. That could mean
        taking a bus to work, carpooling with friends, or finding the nearest UberBike to ride.
        We as people are being handed so many more eco-options with how we go about our days. For some people, that
        could be a homegrown farm, and for us at Sunny Skies, that means eletric cars, and catching the subway to work.
